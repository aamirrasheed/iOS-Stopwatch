iOS-Stopwatch
=================
12/16/14 ----------------------------
Basic stopwatch app with time down to milliseconds. Can time up to 60 minutes. Centered elapsed time, start button
and stop buttons in both portrait and landscape layout.

New things I learned:

1. How to use Auto Layout

2. How to use NSTimer

Things that can be improved: 

1. Better-looking UI

2. Add functionality for laps

3. Option to save each time session with description: i.e. "59.34 - Rubik's cube solve record"
